Dear %%first_name%%,

Recently, we sent you a REWARDS® informational packet, which was delivered to your office, and includes valuable information on this powerful, short-term intervention. REWARDS is the flagship solution of award-winning educator Dr. Anita Archer, and its explicit instruction and highly transferable strategies helps students become better readers and writers as they learn to:

* Decode multisyllabic words
* Build academic vocabulary
* Comprehend content-area textbooks
* You may also be interested in viewing sample lessons from the program as you peruse the packet.

Please contact me with any questions, and I'll be happy to show you how you how REWARDS can help your teachers quickly get struggling readers back on grade level.
